    "In this activity, you will use pgAdmin to recreate and query a table based on image provided to you.\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new database in pgAdmin named `city_info`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the query tool, create an empty table named `cities`. Be sure to match the data types!\n",
    "\n",
